<h4 style="font-size:300%;">Programming languages ​​used in artificial intelligence</h4>
<img src=https://www.zfort.com/images/blog/og/5ee3869fde711_best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI.jpg>
<p style="font-size:160%;">C ++, Java, Lisp, Prolog, Python and R are the main AI programming languages that are best suited for development and design for different kind of software.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Python</p>
<img src=https://www.zfort.com/images/blog/2020/Best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI/python%20best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI.jpg>

<p style="font-size:160%;">The indisputable leader among AI programming languages is Python. It's widely used in all industries and is loved for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. 

First of all, Python is open source. It means that it is available for any modifications developers see necessary. This AI programming language keeps continually evolving, making its syntax easier, which only contributes to its efficiency. 

Secondly, there is a large number of ready-to-use libraries that help accelerate AI coding. For instance, TensorFlow is widely applied for machine learning and working with datasets; scikit - for training machine learning models; PyTorch - for natural language processing and computer vision. This is a tangible benefit that can help accelerate development and save some funds since it assumes applying some ready-made solutions instead of producing them from scratch.

Finally, Python is platform-independent and, on top of that, combines well with other AI programming languages. 

Regardless of the industry or project size, Python is a sound technology choice: it can easily cope with small scripts as well as easily support enterprise applications. 

It's difficult to name one best programming language for AI, but Python is pretty close to it </p>

<p style="font-size:160%;">Lisp</p>
<img src=https://www.zfort.com/images/blog/2020/Best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI/lisp%20best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI.jpg>
<p style="font-size:160%;" >Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages and is actually an ancestor of a few AI programming languages. In fact, the term Artificial Intelligence emerged and was officially introduced after Lisp had been invented by John McCarthy in the 1950th. 

It was fundamental at the time and boosted AI programming being a functional tool for machine learning. Yet, today it's not an often-used AI language but rather a fine vintage for sophisticated lovers who enjoy studying programming history.

The thing is that its many core features that made Lisp attractive for AI programming have migrated to other languages, making them a far better option for machine learning and AI coding. 

Lisp currently lacks libraries and has quite a weird syntax. In addition, it requires special configurations of software and hardware to work with it.

The community gives Lisp proper credit since it represents the origins of artificial intelligence programming languages, but the reality is that it is outranked by other AI programming languages</p>

<p style="font-size:160%;">C++</p>
<img src=https://www.zfort.com/images/blog/2020/Best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI/c-best-ai-programming-language.jpg>
<p style="font-size:160%;">C++ holds the title of "the fastest programming language" that's why it is often used for computer games, desktop apps, and search engine development. For example, Google Chrome is built on C++. 

This AI programming language is primarily a tool for building complex products such as banking software, cloud systems, and enterprise software.

As to AI programming, in particular, C++ has libraries available for machine learning and neural networks that facilitate faster execution of complex algorithms. On the whole, many developers prefer this AI language for building apps that require high productivity, not necessarily code for AI only. 

When deciding on the best AI programming language, C++ should definitely be reviewed as an option since its fast execution is an enormous benefit for AI coding. </p>

<p style="font-size:160%;">Java</p>
<img src=https://www.zfort.com/images/blog/2020/Best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI/java-best-programming-language-for-ai.jpg>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Java is one of the most popular programming languages, and when one thinks of languages for artificial intelligence, Java is certainly on the list.

Its fans mainly appeal to Java Virtual Machine technology, which makes the AI language easy to implement on various platforms. Its significant advantages refer to user-friendliness, fast debugging, and ability to produce nice-looking graphics. 

Java is open source and is supported by numerous libraries, which among others, include Java Machine Learning Library. It's suitable not only for machine learning algorithms, as the name suggests, but also for projects that imply robot systems, sensors, nlp, and neural networks. 

Java solutions can be implemented in any domain, not just data science. 

With Java being one of the leaders as the best language for machine learning and AI programming in general, it is most common for large-scale projects, since its simplified network is handy for supporting big software infrastructures</p>

<p style="font-size:160%;">Prolog<p>
<img src=https://www.zfort.com/images/blog/2020/Best%20programming%20language%20for%20AI/prolog-best-programming-language-for-ai.jpg>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Prolog stands for "Programming in logic." This programming language for AI was created back in the 1960th and varies from other languages common for AI programming nowadays. 

As its description implies, Prolog is a logic language, which is unlike the "classical" AI languages. It operates with a few basic mechanisms, like pattern matching and automatic backtracking. From a developer's standpoint, it assumes specifying rules, facts, and end goals. Not every AI programmer opts for Prolog when deciding to learn AI programming languages.

Prolog's original field of use is natural language processing. For example, the first chatbot ever created, ELIZA, was developed using Prolog. Later on, Prolog has been used in research and education areas for expert systems, theorem proving as well as for some machine learning cases. Prolog is also a part of academic teaching for many artificial intelligence courses. </p>
